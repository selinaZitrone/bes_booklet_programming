- Develop consistent workflows/habits/conventions for your projects
  - apply them to every project
  - start simple

- Think about your workflow beforehand

- While working, keep in mind that someone else (or you from the future) wants to understand, run and reuse the code
- Formatting code and style guides
    - Auto-formatting in IDEs

- Have a naming convention for
  - object and function names
  - files (link to the project structure section)

- Document and comment your code properly
  - Comment on why
- Properly structure your scripts
  - Consider a standardized header explaining purpose of script, author, etc.
  - load packages on top, then global variables, paths etc. and only then the code
  - Separate your scripts into sections
  - If a script becomes to long, split it
